# Project Template

This is a Java Maven Project Template


# How to compile the project

We use Apache Maven to compile and run this project. 

You need to install Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org/)  on your system. 

Type on the command line: 

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

# How to create a binary runnable package 


```bash
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```


# How to run

```bash
mvn clean compile  exec:java -Dexec.args="WikipediaPagesOneDocPerLine.txt.bz2 300"
```

Input file is: 

WikipediaPagesOneDocPerLine.txt.bz2 

Data line batch size is: 300

You can modify the batch size based on available memory.


If you run this over SSH and it takes a lots of time you can run it in background using the following command

```bash
nohub mvn clean compile  exec:java -Dexec.args="WikipediaPagesOneDocPerLine.txt.bz2 500"  & 
```



We recommand the above command for running the Main Java executable. 




# Run all the unit test classes.


```bash
mvn clean compile test checkstyle:check  spotbugs:check
```

# Using Spotbugs to find bugs in your project 

To see bug detail using the Findbugs GUI, use the following command "mvn findbugs:gui"

Or you can create a XML report by using  


```bash
mvn spotbugs:gui 
```

or 


```bash
mvn spotbugs:spotbugs
```


```bash
mvn spotbugs:check 
```

check goal runs analysis like spotbugs goal, and make the build failed if it found any bugs. 


For more info see 
https://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/maven.html


SpotBugs https://spotbugs.github.io/ is the spiritual successor of FindBugs.


# Run Checkstyle 

CheckStyle code styling configuration files are in config/ directory. Maven checkstyle plugin is set to use google code style. 
You can change it to other styles like sun checkstyle. 

To analyze this example using CheckStyle run 

```bash
mvn checkstyle:check
```

This will generate a report in XML format


```bash
target/checkstyle-checker.xml
target/checkstyle-result.xml
```

and the following command will generate a report in HTML format that you can open it using a Web browser. 

```bash
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```

```bash
target/site/checkstyle.html
```
